        <div class="section-description">
          I'm Lindon Jonhson Farias de Morais Junior(Yeah, i know, it's really long name), a brazilian developer born in SÃ£o Paulo.<br/>
          Since i when was a child, i love to create things, could it be stories, drawing something or even buildings using LEGO or building blocks.
          After i got to the CEAP Pedreira, where i got my graduation as a Telecommunication Technician, i had my first contact with programming and eletronics, which are the things that in fell i love with.<br/>
          After i ended the High School, i had no clue of which carrer to follow, i just knew that i loved eletronics and programming, so i was really in doubt about doing something that was more related to programming or eletronics.
          At the end of it I got a scholarship at FIAP, where i was studing System Development and Analysis.
          Also, i'm a lover of arts, moviegoer, pseudo-dancer and the bassist of Na Geral.

        <div class="section-description">
          Back-end: Java
          Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript and some JavaScript frameworks.
          Actually i think that is quite unprecise to say the technologies that i work, once that they're always changing and so, i have to study more, discover new things and improve the old ones, but the technologies above are the 'core' things that i work with.
