            I'm Lindon Jonhson Farias de Morais Junior(Yeah, I know, it's really long name), a brazilian developer born in SÃ£o Paulo.<br/>
            Since I when was a child, i love to create things, could it be stories, drawing something or even buildings using LEGO or building blocks.
            After I got to the CEAP Pedreira, where I got my graduation as a Telecommunication Technician, I had my first contact with programming and eletronics, which are the things that I in fell in love with.<br/>
            After I ended the High School, I had no clue of which carrer to follow, I just knew that I loved eletronics and programming, so I was really in doubt about doing something that was more related to programming or eletronics.
            At the end of it I got a scholarship at FIAP, where I was studing System Development and Analysis.
            Also, I'm a lover of arts, moviegoer, pseudo-dancer and a bass player.

            <p>Those are some of the main technologies that I've studying and working with:</p>
            <h2 id="java-logo">Java</h2>
            <h2 id="css3-logo">CSS3</h2>
            <h2 id="html5-logo">HTML5</h2>
            <h2 id="javascript-logo">JavaScript</h2><br/>
            Actually I think that is quite unprecise to say the technologies that I work with, once that they're always changing and so, I have to study more, discover new things and improve the old ones, but the technologies above are the 'core' things that I work with.
